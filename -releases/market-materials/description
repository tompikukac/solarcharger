The creator of this application does not take any responsibility for the damage and injury what the user may cause or suffer in the future, present or past with or without this software.

Note: Of course this application is not charging your phone. You didn't think so, did you?! The only reason for this app is to collect the mentally challenged trolls - who never read the description this far - complaining about every app. Or you can fool your friends with this nice 'charging feature' if you like.

Do not let your device overheat! Be careful when you put your device under the direct sunlight!
