<h2>Help!</h2>

<p>Wow! you pressed the help menu!</p>
<p>You are one of those rare users who are brave enough to read after something they are curoius!
Maximum respect!<p>

<p>A small hint about this app:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is not charging your battery! Of course not! It\'s not a rocket science to figure out this app never works. It is impossible to solar charge you phone without any hardware solar panel support. </li>
<li>This application is probably draining your battery :) of course not mutch.</li>
</ul>

<p>What actually works then?</p>
<ul>
<li>the light VU meter detects the amount of light what your devices proximity sensor can receive,</li>
<li>you can open/close the VU meter by pressing it</li>
<li>your battery level -displayed on the top- shows correct percentage</li>
<li>if the external light is above a certain level it plays a nice animation for charging.</li>
<li>you can change the solar panel background</li>
<li>you can enable/disable the to prevent the device going to sleep.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why this app is good for then?</p>
<ul>
<li>After a couple of drinks it is fun to show your friends what a brilliant app you have.</li>
<li>It was a good study for this small project to see how the workflowis going on in Android development from the sdk install to an actual release.</li>
<li>Each time I browse the Android market I find idiots giving one star to an application because of their own lame stupidness.
I wanted to collect some of those people\'s and their comments. So I had to create something what is obviously not working :)
To confuse those llamas feel free to give 5 star rating with comments like \'wow it works\' or \'it saved my life\'... Be creative ;)</li>
</ul>
